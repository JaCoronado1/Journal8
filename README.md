The gaming room
The gaming room client wanted to create a cross platform application for a game named Draw It or Lose It. The game would have to have the capability of hosting multiple users
on different platforms
When I was working on the development recommendations I was able to do a lot of research to determine the best processes and application needs.
Working through this document was very helpful in developing the code as I was able to use this as a road map in the development process as knowing what you need is 
important in the design process.
One section I would do over would be the design constaints I feel like I could have had more information on what the constraints are and how to overcome them.
I was able to interpret the needs of the user based on some of the features they wanted like being able to use multiplayer features and being able to store data for the 
users and being able to render images quickly.
I approached designing this software by reading the requirements of the customer and knowing the needs and the features that were required. A strategey that I used was really
knowing the needs and what was desired of the application knowing the needs of the user is important its providing the roadmap on how to design the application.
